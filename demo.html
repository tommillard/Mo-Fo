	<p>But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I don't know exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he isn't well either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab&mdash;so some think&mdash;but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. </p>

	<p>Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!</p>

	<p>And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?</p>

	<p>Come hither to me&mdash;hither, hither," said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me. "Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. 'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It's a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is&mdash;a good man&mdash;not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man&mdash;something like me&mdash;only there's a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of moody&mdash;desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee&mdash;and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife&mdash;not three voyages wedded&mdash;a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!</p>

	<p>As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.</p>

	<p>As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.</p>

	<p>I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;&mdash;but what of that? Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all&mdash;Presbyterians and Pagans alike&mdash;for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.</p>

			<p>Henderson," he called, "you saw that shooting star last night?"</p>

			<p>"Well?" said Henderson.</p>

			<p>"It's out on Horsell Common now."</p>

			<p>"Good Lord!" said Henderson.  "Fallen meteorite!  That's good."</p>

			<p>"But it's something more than a meteorite.  It's a cylinder--an artificial cylinder, man!  And there's something inside."</p>

			<p>Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.</p>

			<p>"What's that?" he said.  He was deaf in one ear.</p>

			<p>Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute or so taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and came out into the road.  The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position.  But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.</p>

			<p>They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead.</p>
